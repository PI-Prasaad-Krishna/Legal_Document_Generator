## üìñ How It Works

1.  **Select a Document:** The user chooses a document type (e.g., Rental Agreement).
2.  **Fill the Form:** A dynamic form appears, prompting the user for specific details relevant to the chosen document.
3.  **Generate:** The application constructs a detailed, structured prompt from the form data.
4.  **Call the AI:** This prompt is sent to the OpenRouter API. The AI uses this information to generate a full, legally-sound document formatted in HTML.
5.  **Preview & Download:** The generated HTML is displayed in a preview modal. The user can then download the document as a perfectly formatted PDF.
